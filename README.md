# Hi, I'm Ahmed 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineering student class 2028 passionate about **embedded systems, mechatronics, and circuit design**.  
I enjoy building systems that combine **electrical, mechanical, and software **

### 🔧 Technologies & Interests
- Embedded Systems (C/C++, Arduino, ESP32, ARM)
- Robotics
- Communication Protocols lika CAN, SPI, I2C, etc...
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Research
- Circuit Design and Prototyping
- Mechanical Design and 3D printing

### 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 **ASME Electrical Team — Lunabotics Robot**
Designing and building the electrical subsystem for a lunar robot competing in NASA’s Lunabotics competition.  
Focus: power distribution, motor control, CAN communication, and embedded systems.

### 🔹 **Wearable ECG Project**
A wearable device capable of measuring, filtering, and transmitting ECG signals.  
Includes analog front-end design and embedded signal processing.

### 🔹 **Sorting Algorithms (C++ Library)**
Implementation of classic sorting algorithms inside a modular project structure.  
Includes: merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, and performance testing.

I love learning, experimenting, and solving real engineering problems.  
Feel free to explore my work — and let's connect!
